## 1. INSTALLATION

SEPA SDD requires PHP 5, no other libraries are required.

To install, copy the SEPASDD.php class to a folder on the webserver and include it as follows:

```php
require_once([path_from_webroot_to_folder]/SEPASDD.php);
```

## 2. CONFIGURATION

SEPA SSD requires a config array, which is validated on initiation.
The following parameters are required:

- name:		    The name of the creditor('s organization).
- IBAN: 	    The creditor's International Bank Account Number.
- BIC:		    The creditor's Bank Identification Code. (optional)
- batch:	    Whether to process as batch or as individual transactions .
		        Allowed: True or False (MUST be boolean).
- creditor_id:	The creditor's id, contact your bank if you do not know this.
- currency:	    The currency in which the amounts are defined. 
		    Allowed: ISO 4217.
- version:	    The PAIN.008.001 version. (optional)
	            Allowed: 3
- validate:     Whether to use the internal validation mechanisms for BIC and IBAN (Optional)
                Allowed: True or False (MUST be boolean).

##### Note:
When setting batch to true, SEPASDD will create a batch for each Direct Debit
transaction type ("FRST","RCUR", etc). and required collection date. This
means that all "FRST" transactions with collection date 2014-01-30 will be 
grouped in a batch.

#### Example:

```php
$config = array("name" => "Test",
                "IBAN" => "NL50BANK1234567890",
                "BIC" => "BANKNL2A",
                "batch" => true,
                "creditor_id" => "00000",
                "currency" => "EUR"
                );
```

## 3. USAGE

### 3.1 Initialization

Create an instance of the class with an configuration as such:

```php
try{
    $SEPASDD = new SEPASDD($config);
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

### 3.2 Create a payment

SEPA SDD uses the addPayment method for creating payments, it requires a payment array.
The following parameters are required:

- name:			    The debtors name.
			    Allowed: 140 ASCII characters (ISO 20022 MaxText140)
- IBAN: 		    The debtor's International Bank Account Number.
			    Allowed: /[a-zA-Z]{2}[0-9]{2}[a-zA-Z0-9]{4}[0-9]{7}([a-zA-Z0-9]?){0,16}/ (Note: This class does not perform check digit (index 2 and 3) validation. Please provide this yourself. 
- BIC:			    The debtor's Bank Identification Code. (optional)
			    Allowed: ([a-zA-Z]{4}[a-zA-Z]{2}[a-zA-Z0-9]{2}([a-zA-Z0-9]{3})?)
- amount:		    The amount to transfer from debtor to creditor (IN CENTS).
			        Allowed: int/string (NO SEPARATORS) e.g. EUR 10.00 has to be entered as 1000 or "1000"
- type:			    The type of Direct Debit Transaction
			        Allowed: FRST (First), RCUR (Recurring), OOFF (One Off), FNAL (Final)
- collection_date:  The date at which the amount should be collected from the debtor.
                    Allowed: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). This date should be in the future, how far in
                             the future is dependent on the type of Direct Debit. See the definition.
- mandate_id:       The ID of the written mandate from the debtor.
		    Allowed: 35 ASCII characters. (ISO 20022 MaxText35)
- mandate_date:     The date the mandate was signed.
                    Allowed: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). For mandates before SEPA requirements this is: 2009-11-01.
- description:      The description of the transaction.
		    Allowed: 140 ASCII characters (ISO 20022 MaxText140)

The following parameters are optional:

- end_to_end_id:    The unique (for ALL transactions ever done by creditor) id referencing this payment.
		    Allowed: 35 ASCII characters. (ISO 20022 MaxText35) 

The method will return the end_to_end_id.

#### Example:

```php
$payment = array("name" => "Test von Testenstein",
                 "IBAN" => "NL50BANK1234567890",
                 "BIC" => "BANKNL2A",
                 "amount" => "1000",
                 "type" => "FRST",
                 "collection_date" => "2013-07-12",
                 "mandate_id" => "1234",
                 "mandate_date" => "2009-11-01",
                 "description" => "Test Transaction"
                );                
```

Then use the addPayment method to add the payment to the file:

#### Example:

```php
try{
    $endToEndId = $SEPASDD->addPayment($payment);
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

You can use this method multiple times to add more payments.

### 3.3 Save the file

To save the file, use the `save` method, this will return the XML as a string.
If you want to save to file, you have to do this yourself.

#### Example:

```php
try{
    $SEPASDD->save();
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

After this, please reinitialize the class if you want to create another file.


### 3.4 Get the summary from the direct debit

If you want to have some feedback on the direct debit (either before or after saving),
you can use the `getDirectDebitInfo()` method. This will return an array in the following format:

```
Batch mode:
Array
(
    [MessageId] => "100120165539-15a2054e7b05"
    [TotalTransactions] => 3
    [TotalAmount] => "3000"
    [FirstCollectionDate] => "2016-01-10"
    [Batches] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [CollectionDate] => "2016-01-10"
                    [Type] => "FRST"
                    [BatchId] => "Test-d1837e0f72cb"
                    [BatchTransactions] => 2
                    [BatchAmount] => "2000"
                )

            [1] => Array
                (
                    [CollectionDate] => "2016-01-10"
                    [Type] => "RCUR"
                    [BatchId] => "Test-145750c3b3a8"
                    [BatchTransactions] => 1
                    [BatchAmount] => "1000"
                )

        )

)

Non Batch mode:
Array
(
    [MessageId] => "100120161833-fbba1f5fc10a"
    [TotalTransactions] => 3
    [TotalAmount] => "3000"
    [FirstCollectionDate] => "2016-01-10"
)




```

#### Example:

```php
try{
    $SEPASDD->save();
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

After this, please reinitialize the class if you want to create another file.
### 3.4 Adding custom fields

SEPA SDD has a special method for adding custom fields. This method is called addCustomNode.
It is important to know that you will have to save the direct debit before and after calling this.
The required arguments are:

- parent_XPATH:     The XPATH selector of the parent.
- name:             The node/tag name.
- value:            Its value, default "".
- attr:             An array containing key => value pairs defining the attributes.

#### Example:

Add the postal address for the last inserted Debtor. 

Caution, you should know what you are doing here.
Refer to the SEPA Direct Debit Core Rulebook and the XSD before using this. 

```php
$payment = array("name" => "Test von Testenstein",
                 "IBAN" => "NL50BANK1234567890",
                 "BIC" => "BANKNL2A",
                 "amount" => "1000",
                 "type" => "FRST",
                 "collection_date" => "2013-07-12",
                 "mandate_id" => "1234",
                 "mandate_date" => "2009-11-01",
                 "description" => "Test Transaction"
                );

try{
    $SEPASDD->addPayment($payment);
    $SEPASDD->save();
    $SEPASDD->addCustomNode("//Document/CstmrDrctDbtInitn/PmtInf[last()]/DrctDbtTxInf[last()]/Dbtr","PstlAdr");
    $SEPASDD->addCustomNode("//Document/CstmrDrctDbtInitn/PmtInf[last()]/DrctDbtTxInf[last()]/Dbtr/PstlAdr","AdrLine","Rode Weeshuisstraat 25");
    $SEPASDD->addCustomNode("//Document/CstmrDrctDbtInitn/PmtInf[last()]/DrctDbtTxInf[last()]/Dbtr/PstlAdr","AdrLine","9712 ET Groningen");
    $SEPASDD->save();
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

Will create

```xml
<PstlAdr>
    <AdrLine>Rode Weeshuisstraat 25</AdrLine>
    <AdrLine>9712 ET Groningen</AdrLine>
</PstlAdr>
```

### 3.5 Validation

To validate against the pain.008.001.02 or pain.008.001.03 schema definition, you can
use the validate() method. This requires the XML as string as argument.

##### Note: 
Some banks allow not specifying a BIC, and so does SEPASDD.

#### Example

```php
try{
    $xml = $SEPASDD->save();
    $validation = $SEPASDD->validate($xml);
    print_r($validation);
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```
